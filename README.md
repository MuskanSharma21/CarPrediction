# Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is aimed at predicting the prices of used cars using linear regression. I have trained the model on a dataset of various car features such as selling price, year of purchase, present price, kms driven and fuel type. The model can help buyers and sellers estimate the value of a car based on its features.
